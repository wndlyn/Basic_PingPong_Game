## Project Overview

The PingPong game is a basic arcade-style game that provides a fun and interactive experience. The game consists of a paddle controlled by the player and a ball that bounces off the walls and paddles. The game becomes more challenging over time as the speed of the ball increases.

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against the computer-controlled opponent.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The ball's speed increases the longer you play, making it harder to win.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple Game Logic**: Basic collision detection and movement for the ball and paddle.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface, including the canvas for the game display.
- **CSS**: Styling the game interface, including the layout and appearance of the elements.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic of the game, including paddle movement, ball physics, collision detection, and increasing difficulty.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the game running on your local machine:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Or download the zip file and extract it.

2. **Open the Game**:
   - Navigate to the directory where the files are located and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. **Play the Game**:
   - Once the game loads in your browser, you can start playing immediately.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. **Controls**:
   - Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to move the paddle.
   - The game will start automatically, and you must prevent the ball from passing your paddle.

3. **Objective**:
   - Keep the ball in play as long as possible.
   - The game speed will gradually increase, making it more challenging to react.

4. **Game Over**:
   - If the ball passes your paddle, the game will reset, and you will need to start over.

## Game Logic

- **Ball Movement**: The ball moves across the screen in a straight line, bouncing off the top and bottom walls.
- **Paddle Movement**: The player's paddle moves up and down in response to the arrow keys.
- **Collision Detection**: The ball will bounce off the paddle. If the ball hits the left side of the screen (past the player's paddle), the game ends.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The ball's speed increases over time. This is intended to keep the game challenging as the player progresses.
